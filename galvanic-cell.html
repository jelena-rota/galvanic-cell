<p style = "text-align:justify">A <b>galvanic cell</b>, also known as voltaic cell, is an electrochemical cell that generates electrical energy through a spontaneous reaction taking place in the cell. It consists of two half cells connected via external electrical circuit and via salt bridge.</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">A <b>half cell</b> contains a metal strip submerged into a solution of the metal's salt. Our example shows zinc-zinc chloride half cell (zinc electrode) and copper-copper sulfate half cell (copper electrode).</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">Two half cells are connected through a flow of electrons from zinc to copper electrode (external electrical circuit) and through a flow of ions (salt bridge).</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">The <b>oxidation</b> of Zn<sub>(s)</sub> into Zn<sup>2+</sup> and the <b>reduction</b> of Cu<sup>2+</sup> into Cu<sub>(s)</sub> occur spontaneously due to a difference in the potential energy between Zn and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The oxidation takes place at the zinc anode and reduction takes place at the copper cathode.</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">Oxidation: Zn<sub>(s)</sub> &#8594; Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup></p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">Reduction: Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> &#8594; Cu<sub>(s)</sub></p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">Electrons that are released at the zinc anode flow through the external electrical circuit towards the copper cathode.</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">A <b>salt bridge</b> is required to maintain electrical neutrality and allow the reaction to continue. Our salt bridge containing KNO<sub>3</sub> is adding NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> into the anode solution and K<sup>+</sup> into the cathode solution in order to prevent charge build up.</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">The potential difference between two electrodes is called <b>standard cell potential</b> (E<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub>) under standard state conditions: concentrations of 1 M, pressure of 1 atmosphere and temperature of 25 <sup>o</sup>C. It can be calculated using standard electrode potential, E<sup>o</sup>, in volts, for each of the two half reactions:</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">E<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>o</sup><sub>cathode</sub> - E<sup>o</sup><sub>anode</sub></p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">For our example:</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">E<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = 0.337 V - (-0.763 V) = 1.100 V</p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">In a galvanic cell, where a spontaneous reaction takes place, <b>Gibbs free energy</b> &#8710;G is negative and cell potential is positive, which is in accordance with the following equation:</p>

<p>&#8710;G = &#8722;nFE<sub>cell</sub></p>

<p style = "text-align:justify">where n is the number of moles of electrons and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol).</p>
